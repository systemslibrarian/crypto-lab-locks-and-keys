/*
 * The run-scoped sink that makes a mutation record UNFORGEABLE.
 *
 * §4.1c of the build standard asks that every `observed` record be written by the
 * thing that ran it, never typed. Writing them is the easy half. The half that
 * matters is this: an archived record is only worth something if an UNPERFORMED
 * record fails the suite. Otherwise the ledger is a second copy of an answer
 * nobody is checking, and a kill that stopped happening stays recorded forever.
 *
 * So each claims test calls `witness()` with the (test, marker) pair it actually
 * asserted, an `afterEach` records which tests ran at all, and `enforceLedger()`
 * fails the run when a recorded kill names a pair its own test ran without
 * witnessing.
 *
 * `crypto-lab-privacy-pass` writes its observed lines into its ledger;
 * `crypto-lab-hidden-bit` and `crypto-lab-pqxdh-wire` deliberately do not, and
 * their reason is the better one — enforcement is the requirement, archival is a
 * choice. This lab does both, because `README.md` quotes the ledger, and a quoted
 * record that nothing enforces is exactly the drift this file prevents.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A `globalTeardown`. It was, and that was wrong in a way worth
 * recording. The teardown tried to decide whether the claims suite had run by
 * asking whether `claims` was in `config.projects` — on the belief that
 * Playwright filters that list to the selected projects. IT DOES NOT: the full
 * project list is passed whatever `--project` was given. So an a11y-only run
 * enforced the claims ledger, found no witnesses, and failed the accessibility
 * gate — three passing a11y tests reported under a red step naming the wrong
 * subject, which is the precise failure §4.1a exists to prevent, reintroduced by
 * the machinery meant to enforce honesty. Caught on CI, where the a11y gate and
 * the claims suite run as separate steps.
 *
 * The fix is not a better guess at which projects ran. It is to stop asking: each
 * ledger entry is checked only if ITS OWN owning test ran in this invocation, so
 * the check is scoped by observation rather than by inference. A full claims run
 * checks everything; a single `-g` test checks only itself; an a11y run checks
 * nothing, because no claims test ran.
