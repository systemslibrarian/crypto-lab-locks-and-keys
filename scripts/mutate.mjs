/*
 * mutate.mjs — run the mutations in mutations/mutations.json and write the ledger.
 *
 * Run: npm run mutations
 *
 * §4.1c of the catalog's _MASTER-TEMPLATE.md says a green suite is not evidence
 * until you have watched it fail, and that for a lab rendering verdict markers
 * the watching is done by a script rather than by a person — because a person
 * who performs the five steps then writes the result down afterwards, and a
 * sentence describing a run is the author's side of the claim rather than the
 * run's.
 *
 * THE FOUR KILL RULES, AND WHERE EACH IS ENFORCED BELOW.
 *
 *   1. The owning test PASSED UNMUTATED in the same run.   -> `baseline()`
 *   2. The patch actually CHANGED the file.                -> `applyPatches()`
 *   3. The run served the MUTATED code.                    -> `hashBundle()`
 *   4. A patch that does not compile is DOES NOT BUILD,
 *      and is never a kill.                                -> `build()`
 *
 * Rule 3 is a property rather than a mechanism, and the fleet satisfies it two
 * ways: crypto-lab-privacy-pass requires the built bundle's hash to move;
 * crypto-lab-hidden-bit classifies the failure instead, refusing any red run
 * whose output looks like a build error or a server that never started.
 * crypto-lab-pqxdh-wire does both. THIS SCRIPT DOES BOTH, and the second half
 * matters more than it looks here: Playwright's `reuseExistingServer:
 * !process.env.CI` means a preview server already listening on 4721 is reused
 * and the webServer command — the command that BUILDS — never runs at all. A
 * mutation run against a stale server would read every mutation as a survivor.
 * So `CI=1` is set on every child process, which turns that reuse off and makes
 * the port strict.
 *
 * Rule 1 is why the baseline is re-measured in the same invocation rather than
 * assumed from a previous green run: a test that was already failing for an
 * unrelated reason would otherwise be recorded as killed by every mutation that
 * touched it.
 *
 * The ledger it writes is enforced, not merely archived. Each claims test calls
 * `witness()` from e2e/evidence.ts with the (test, marker) pair it actually
 * asserted, and an `afterAll` in that spec fails any later full claims run in
 * which a recorded kill's own test ran WITHOUT asserting the marker the record
 * names. So a kill can only stay recorded while the assertion that produced it
 * still exists.
 *
 * (That enforcement lived in a `globalTeardown` first. Playwright passes the FULL
 * project list there whatever `--project` was given, so an a11y-only run enforced
 * the claims ledger and failed the ACCESSIBILITY GATE with all its tests passing.
 * See e2e/evidence.ts.)
